    description: "The BMW 640i F13 was the coupe variant of the second-generation 6 Series, with the F13 designation specifically denoting the two-door coupe body style (F12 was convertible, F06 was Gran Coupe). The 640i featured a 3.0L turbocharged inline-six engine (N55) producing 315-320 HP depending on the market, paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Performance was impressive with 0-60 mph acceleration in approximately 5.3 seconds. The F13 6 Series featured flowing, elegant styling with classic proportions and luxury grand touring characteristics. The interior offered premium materials, advanced technology including iDrive infotainment, and a driver-focused cockpit design. The 640i was positioned as a more efficient yet still powerful alternative to the V8-powered 650i model, combining strong performance with reasonable fuel economy for its class. Available with optional xDrive all-wheel drive in some markets, the 640i F13 represented BMW's approach to the luxury GT coupe segment, emphasizing long-distance comfort, style, and performance."
